          My name is Ruben Ruiz, and I'm currently employed as a Technical Support Specialist at Bluebeam Inc. I look to transition into a full stack developer. With over 7 years of experience in technical support and troubleshooting, I've developed a strong foundation in software and various operating systems. However, I've always been passionate about development and decided to pursue a career in it.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">
          I'm now excited to leverage my technical support experience and new development skills to become a front-end developer.
          </p>
          <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry developments. I'm a detail-oriented problem solver, and I'm committed to delivering high-quality work that meets the needs of my clients and users.
